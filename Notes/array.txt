The size of the array once created is fixed we cant delete or add elements we can only assign vlaues to one of the ten elements in this array
The toString method on this helper class prints out all the array elements comma delimited and contained in square brackets 
String arrayElementsInAString = Arrays.toString(newArray);
the static method binary search tree is on the array class :
for binary search :
	The array has to to be sorted first 
	if there is any duplicate values there is no guarantee which one it'll match on 
	elements must be comparable trying to compare instances of different types may lead to errors and invalid results 
This method returns :
	The position of a match if found 
	It returns a -1 when no match was found 
	its important to remeber that a positive number may not be the position of the first match 
	If your array has a duplicate value and you need to find the first element other methods should be used
