bWhat is a list ?
List is a special type in java called interface.

What is a ArrayList?
->The ArrayList is a class that really maintains an array in memeory that's actually bigger than what we need in most cases; it keeps track of the capacity which is the actual size of the array in the memory 
  as the eleemnets are are added in an ArrayList it's capacity may need to grow. this all happends automatically behind the scenes, this is why ArrayList is resixeable.
An ArrayList is implemented on the top of an array where as a linked list is doubly linked list.
LinkedLit also implements the Queue and Stack methods as well
What is a iterator ?
	->A kind of curser we're refereing to here can be described as an object that allows traversal over records in a collection 
How does it work?
	-> When you get an instance of an iterator you can call the next method to get the next element in the list 
You can use the hasNext method to check if any elements remain to be processed 
You can see a while loop which uses the iterator hasNext method to determine if it should continue loping 
IN the loop the next method is called and its value assigned to a local variable and the local variable printedd out 
this would jsut print each element ina alist but do it through the iterator object 

An iterator is forward only and only supports the remove methods
A listleterator can be used to go both orward and backwards and in addition to the remove moethod it also supports the add and set methods
a linked list is a doubly linked list, the linked list implement list methods but also queue and stack method as well
The hasPrevious( ) method returns true if there is a previous element. Otherwise, returns false. The previous( ) method Returns the previous element

AUTOBOXING AND UNBOXING 
What is boxing 
: A primitive is boxed or wrapped in a containing class whose main data is the primitive value.  Each primitve data type has a wrapper class as shown on the list which have seen before
each wrapper type boxes a specific primitive value
Each wrapper has a static overloaded factory method valueOf(), which takes a primitve and returns an instance of the wrapper class 
Integer boxedInt = Integer.valueOf(15); 

The valueOf method returns the relevant Number Object holding the value of the argument passed

ENUMERATION 
The enum type is javas type to support something called an enumeration.
A complete ordered listing of all the items in a collection 
java defines it as a special datatype that contains predefined constants. A constant variable whole value cannot be changed once its value has been assigned 
So an enum is little like an array except its element are known not changable and each element can be reffered to by constant name instead of an index position 

public enum DayOfWeek{
	SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,THURDAY , FRIDAY , SATURDAY 
}
 An enum is ordered by the way you declare the constants 

We can pass linked list in the parameter with the conventions list<string/integer/variable>

LinkedList<FlightEnabled> fliers = new LinkedList<>();
        fliers.add(bird);

private static void triggerFliers(LinkedList<FlightEnabled> fliers){
        for(var flier : fliers){
            flier.takeOff();
        }
    }
